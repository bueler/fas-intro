This little project is finished.  I posted the documentation as a preprint to [arxiv.org/abs/2101.05408](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05408).  I do not plan to pursue publication.

The program `fas1.py` in directory `py/` demonstrates by example how the _full approximation storage_ (FAS) multigrid scheme works.  It solves an easy nonlinear ODE BVP using piecewise-linear finite elements and a nonlinear Gauss-Seidel smoother.

## Documentation (the preprint)

Read `fas.pdf` in `doc/` after generating it:

        $ cd doc/
        $ make

Clean up the LaTeX clutter in `doc/` with

        $ make clean

## Run the program

To get started do

        $ cd py/
        $ ./fas1.py -h

Do the following simple run using FAS V-cycles on a mesh of 2^6=64 subintervals:

        $ ./fas1.py -K 6 -monitor -show

The following solves to discretization error on fine meshes in a single F-cycle using 9 WU:

        $ for KK in 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16; do ./fas1.py -mms -fcycle -K $KK -cyclemax 1; done

See also the convergence study, using a version of the problem with a known exact solution (method of manufactured solutions), in `py/study/converge.sh`.  Solver complexity (optimality), namely runtime and work units, is studied in in `py/study/optimal.sh` and `py/study/slow.sh`.  These are described in section 6 of `doc/fas.pdf`.

Run software tests:

        $ make test
